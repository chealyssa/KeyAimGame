## KeyAim Game Write-Up
Inspired by the famous game on Steam, AimLab. AimLab is a practice aim game where players use their mouse to hit the target on the screen. KeyAim, instead of targeting with a mouse, players use the keyboard. KeyAim game tests the player's familiarity with the keyboard and hand-eye coordination. KeyAim game (as of version 4) has three difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The difficulty “easy”  has a constant time limit of three seconds, and it runs infinitely. The difficulty “medium” has an exponential rate time limit of 0.1 for each point earned, and only allows 10 incorrect tries. The difficulty “hard” has an exponential rate time of 0.2 for each point, and only allows 5 incorrect times.
