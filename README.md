KeyAim Game Write-Up
Description and brief explanation:
	Inspired by the famous game on Steam, AimLab. AimLab is a practice aim game where players use their mouse to hit the target on the screen. KeyAim, instead of targeting with a mouse, players use the keyboard. KeyAim game tests the player's familiarity with the keyboard and hand-eye coordination. KeyAim game (as of version 4) has three difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard. The difficulty “easy”  has a constant time limit of three seconds, and it runs infinitely. The difficulty “medium” has an exponential rate time limit of 0.1 for each point earned, and only allows 10 incorrect tries. The difficulty “hard” has an exponential rate time of 0.2 for each point, and only allows 5 incorrect times. 
Accomplishment:
	The main accomplishment I accomplished during this project was creating my very first original game using Python’s PyGames. This is not my first time creating a game, but it is my first time creating a game using my original ideas. In the past, I have always only recreated a game, for example, “Rock Paper Scissors” or “Higher Lower,” but this time, I was able to come up with my idea of a game and able to implement it in PyGames.  
	Another accomplishment was that I was able to apply my knowledge learned during the semester, all in a project. As a seasoned coder/programmer, I have programmed with multiple languages, but Python was one of the languages that I was not able to fully learn as my major usually just offered Java or C. Being able to learn Python in such a short time and also using it to make a game is an accomplishment for me. 


Sources Used:
	I used the website Pygame to refer to examples of how to implement basics, such as displays, putting images, using Pygame events and clock ticks. Another website that I used was the article Real Python, to learn how to use the game loop, drawing on screen using fill and blit, and using sprites. A YouTube source that I used was Coding With Russ, where I learned how to add a button.
Interesting Features:
	Something that I plan to implement in my game is difficulties. When I came up with my game idea, I realized that the base game was too easy, therefore I came up with the idea of adding difficulties. Currently, I have three different difficulties: Normal, Easy, and Hard. In my game, the normal difficulty is the “Start” button. 
Challenges: 
	My main challenge was organizing my code. My code was coded in phases where each phase introduces a different feature. Every time I try to implement the phases, I would need to rearrange my code while also keeping my original working code. 
How I resolve it:
I was able to resolve this by creating multiple Python files, when a new phase is introduced, a new Python file is created named slightly different (PyGamesTest2/PyGamesTest3). With this, I could freely edit my new code without worrying that my original code would not run. If a feature ends up not working, I can just go to a lower version of my code.
